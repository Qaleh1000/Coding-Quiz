# Coding-Quiz

A multiple choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and players initials

## Description

Creating a coding quiz with multiple-choice questions presented a notable challenge that pushed the boundaries of our research and learning capabilities in JavaScript. Our goal was to craft a timed quiz that not only gauges participants' knowledge but also records and associates their scores with respective initials. In the event of an incorrect answer, the game introduces a time deduction mechanism to add an extra layer of complexity. Post-game, participants have the opportunity to review the scores of all individuals who engaged in the quiz.
Furthermore, the addition of clearing of high scores, facilitated a clean slate for those eager to embark on a new round of the game.
